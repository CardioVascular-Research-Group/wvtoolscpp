v1.2 (updated Monday, June 27th 2016)
Ran Liu (rliu14@jhu.edu)

A C++ utility to read data from Phillips 16-bit little-endian waveform files.
Allows for the generation of a PhysioNet header file.
Can also produce quality annotations.

Build Requirements:
CMake

Dependencies:
Boost C++ (Program_Options, Regex) (http://www.boost.org/)
GoogleTest (https://github.com/google/googletest)
JSON for Modern C++ (https://github.com/nlohmann/json)
restclient-cpp (https://github.com/mrtazz/restclient-cpp)
libcurl

Usage: wvtools [options]

Required options:
  -r [ --record ] arg   Record prefix of waveform data to read

Allowed options:
  -h [ --help ]          Prints program usage help
  -u [ --unscaled ]      If this option is passed, the program prints unscaled
                         data. Scaled is the default.
  -p [ --physionet ]     If this option is passed, the program writes a
                         physionet header instead of amplitudes
  -c [ --checksums ]     If this option is passed, the program prints the
                         checksums for each channel
  -f [ --features ]      If this option is passed, the program emits the
                         feature vectors for the specified channel
  -t [ --timestamps ]    If this option is passed, the timestamps column is
                         included
  -h [ --no-headers ]    If this option is passed, the headers row is omitted
  -q [ --quality ]       If this option is passed, the program outputs quality
                         annotations.
  -s [ --svm ] arg       Passes a file containing SVM parameters for quality
                         checking.
  -x [ --channel ] arg   Quality values are emitted for the specified channel
                         (0-indexed).
  -n [ --num-channels ]  Program writes the number of channels contained in a
                         record.
  -v [ --version ]       Prints version information for program.
